# TODO

## Short Term

- [x] configure `cmake` appropriatly and ensure seperation of concern.
- [x] work out how debug and dist builds are handled in a configurable way.
- [] work out wether overloaded functions to submit geometery is better or function templates
- [] clean up the member data for the renderer and camera
- [] get a minimal example compiling using metal

## Long Term

- Getting textures and shaders actually configure well this time.
- have terrain generation that concerns itself only with producing the noise and not being dependant on chunks.
- have a chunking system that isnt concerned about data but rather can manage different types of chunks.

- Include METAL as a render API
