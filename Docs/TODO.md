# TODO

## Short Term

- configure `cmake` appropriatly and ensure seperation of concern.
- work out how debug and dist builds are handled in a configurable way.

## Long Term

- Getting textures and shaders actually configure well this time.
- have terrain generation that concerns itself only with producing the noise and not being dependant on chunks.
- have a chunking system that isnt concerned about data but rather can manage different types of chunks.
