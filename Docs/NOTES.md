# Notes

Not important just to keep info that may be relevent as I think of it and typically quickly forget.

## OpenGl

- `ALPHA` channel is deprecated on macOS but can be replaced with `GL_RED` or `GL_RG`

## LHCraft

- change the debug macros to be `ifdef` based on the value define in the `cmakeConfig.h`
